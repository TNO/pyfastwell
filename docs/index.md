# pyfastwell Documentation

Welcome to the pyfastwell documentation!

This project provides tools for Analytical Element Model well performance calculations for advanced well architectures (e.g. multi-laterals, horizontal wells, steel shot drilling, fish bones etc),
coldfront tracking in the reservoir, geothermal doublet techno-economic performance, including well flow results, coldfront evolution, and thermal performance.

pywellfast can complement [DoubletCalc1D](https://www.nlog.nl/en/tools). DoubletCalc1D is a probabilistic doublet technical performance assessment tool  
developed by TNO that calculates how much geothermal water can be pumped at a given pump power, for a simple well architecture (van Wees et al., 2012), 
and served to develop geothermal energy potential in the Netherlands (Mijnlieff, 2020; Mijnlieff et al., 2025).
It takes into account well engineering aspects and specific subsurface conditions, including aquifer temperature, and reservoir flow properties. 
The software and manual can be downloaded from [Doubletcalc1D](https://www.nlog.nl/tools).
